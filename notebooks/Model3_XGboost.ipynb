For example, it can recognize that \"Upbeat Party Anthem\" and \"Dance All Night\" are related by their shared theme of energetic, danceable music, even if they don't contain identical words.\n","* **Contextual Relationships:** DistilBERT can recognize that tracks with similar themes or moods are likely to follow each other.\n","\n","In contrast, Bag of Words treats each word independently, missing these contextual relationships and making it less effective for sequence-based tasks like predicting the next track."],"metadata":{"id":"DxxEWpMWjjMd"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pf2haS2pdrUr"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import
