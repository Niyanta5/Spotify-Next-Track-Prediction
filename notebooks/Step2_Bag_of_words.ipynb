twice, girl\\n'Cause you be playing games I don't like\\nThat's the type of shit I don't like, girl\\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\\nI don't like it when I hit you up, you don't call back\\nThere ain't no need for all that\\nBreaking up, just to make up\\nTell me when you had enough of this playing that you do, girl\\nBut now you saying that we don't communicate\\nDon't you know communication travel both ways?\\nWe been going through the motions for a few days\\nI'm so tired of fighting, girl, ain't you tired of fighting?\\nLet's go back to being lovers, baby, tell me how you like it\\nI can tell that you excited, is it true, girl?\\nIf you think you're horny now\\nCome and let a real nigga slide through, girl\\nI will hit you up so you know what to do, girl\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nWhen I call your phone tonight\\nI better not have to call twice, girl\\n'Cause you be playing games I don't like\\nThat's the type of shit I don't like, girl5Embed\",\n          \"11 ContributorsSara

staring at the tick-tock clock\\nAnd even if I could I would never give up\\nWith a vest on my chest, a bullet in my lung\\nI can't believe I'm dying with my song unsung\\nAnd if and when I die, won't you bury me alone?\\n'Cause I'll never get to heaven if I'm singing this song\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nIf there was something wrong, would you be oh-so strong?\\nWould you do what it takes to move this hollow life along?\\nI'd like to think I would, you know I'd like to think I would\\nBut I can guarantee that what you see is not reality\\nAnd every time she makes a point, I make a counterpoint\\nShe said it's easy, but in the end you'll have no choice\\nAnd you know, that's only just the way that it goes\\nYou said it right man, that is just the way that it goes\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nAnd the days, and the days, they seem like forever\\nAnd the days, and the days, they seem like forever, but forever isn't ever enough!\\nI'd like to sing a song (Promise you won't be long)\\nI'll try not to be long, but I don't want to get this story wrong\\nThere was a kid who never cared about the little things\\nDon't even bother, 'cause I'm tired and I'm sick of it\\nAnd every time she makes a point, I'll make a counterpoint\\nShe said, it's easy, but in the end you'll have no choice\\nAnd you know that's only just the way that it goes\\nYou said it right man, that is just the way that it goes\\nSee

you don't know) you don't know what I've seen\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nIf I did something right, would you give up this fight?\\nWould you say you were wrong and maybe someone else was kind-of right?\\nI'd like to think you would, you know I'd like to think you would\\nBut I can't guarantee that what you get is an apology\\nJump back to the day we met I never\\nThought that it would end this way, if ever\\nI let you down, I want to ask of you\\nTo take it down a notch, and we can talk it on through\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nAnd the days, and the days, they seem like forever\\nAnd the days, and the days, they seem like forever, but forever isn't ever enough!\\nI'd like to sing a song (Promise you won't be long)\\nI'll try not to be long, but I don't want to get this story wrong\\nThere was a chick who never cared about the little things\\nDon't bother, 'cause I still don't give a shit\\nAnd every time she makes a point, I'll make a counterpoint\\nShe said, it's easy, but in the end you'll have no choice\\nAnd you know that's only just the way that it goes\\nYou said it right man, that is just the way that it goes\\n[Chorus]\\nI've got a gun in my hand, but the gun won't cock\\nMy finger's on the trigger, but that trigger seems locked\\nAnd I can't stop staring at the tick-tock clock\\nAnd even if I could I would never give up\\nWith a vest on my chest, a bullet in my lung\\nI can't believe I'm dying with my song unsung\\nAnd if and when I die, won't you bury me alone?\\n'Cause I'll never get to heaven if I'm singing this song\\n\\n[Post-Chorus]\\nOh, (you don't know, you don't know) you don't know where I've been\\nOh, (you don't know, you don't know) you don't know what I've seen\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nSo tell me friend, how's it going to end\\nWhen the shit goes down and there's no one left around to get your back?\\nYou'll crack, you'll smile and agree with everything they say\\nThey'll try to tell you that it's all okay\\nBut it's not, and you're shot, and you're bleeding pretty bad\\nAnd you can't stop thinking about the things you never had\\nLike a wife and a kid and the things you never did\\nRunning around, livin' a life that's empty in the end, my friend\\nOh, you'll take back all you've said\\nOh, when the regrets fill your head\\nTrust me, I've been there before\\nI would not wish it upon\\nMy greatest enemy, what irony, once friends, but I find\\nYou'll have to learn this lesson on your own\\n[Brass solo]\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nSo, I waited by the phone, but that phone never rang\\nAnd I sang so loud so I wouldn't hear the bang\\nWhen the bang never came and I never got the call\\nFuck it! Thank you! I love you all\\nSome are going to say that we're doomed to repeat\\nAll our past mistakes, great, but that's not me\\nAnd even if it was, I would always disagree\\nBecause in the end I always get the better (of me)\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nI've got a gun in my hand, but the gun won't cock\\nMy finger's on the trigger, but that trigger seems locked\\nAnd I can't stop staring at the tick-tock clock\\nAnd even if I could I would never give up\\nWith a vest on my chest, a bullet in my lung\\nI can't believe I'm dying with my song unsung\\nAnd if and when I die, won't you bury me alone?\\n'Cause I'll never get to heaven if I'm singing this song\\n\\n[Post-Chorus]\\nOh, (I'll take you, I'll take you) I'll take you where I've been\\nOh, (I'll show you, I'll show you) I'll show you what I've seen3Embed\",\n          \"146 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschSeven Nation Army Lyrics[Verse 1]\\nI'm gonna fight 'em off\\nA seven-nation army couldn't hold me back\\nThey're gonna rip it off\\nTakin' their time right behind my back\\nAnd I'm talkin' to myself at night because I can't forget\\nBack and forth through my mind, behind a cigarette\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nAnd the message comin' from my eyes says, \\\"Leave it alone\\\"\\n[Instrumental Chorus]\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nDon't wanna hear about it\\nEvery single one's got a story to tell\\nEveryone knows about it\\nFrom the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell\\nAnd if I catch it comin' back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you\\nAnd that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nAnd the feelin' comin' from my bones says, \\\"Find a home\\\"\\n[Instrumental Chorus]\\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\\n\\n[Verse 3]\\nI'm goin' to Wichita\\nFar from this opera forevermore\\nI'm gonna work the straw\\nMake the sweat drip out of every pore\\nAnd I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' right before the Lord\\nAll the words are gonna bleed from me and I will think no more\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nAnd the stains comin' from my blood tell me, \\\"Go back home\\\"\\n[Instrumental Chorus]115Embed\",\n          \"264 ContributorsTranslationsEspa\\u00f1olPortugu\\u00easHebrewEnglishDeutschBosanskiItalianoBillie Jean Lyrics[Verse 1]\\nShe was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene\\nI said, \\\"Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one\\nWho will dance on the floor in the round?\\\"\\nShe said I am the one\\nWho will dance on the floor in the round\\nShe told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene\\nThen every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one\\nWho will dance on the floor in the round\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nPeople always told me, \\\"Be careful of what you do\\nDon't go around breakin' young girls' hearts\\\" (Hee-hee)\\nAnd mother always told me, \\\"Be careful of who you love\\nAnd be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)\\n'Cause the lie becomes the truth\\\" (Oh-oh), hey-ey\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBillie Jean is not my lover, uh\\nShe's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)\\nBut the kid is not my son (Hoo)\\nShe says I am the one (Oh, baby)\\nBut the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nFor forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side\\nBut who can stand when she's in demand?
