# 🎶 Next Track Recommender System 🎶

This project aims to develop a **Next Track Recommender System** for music streaming platforms 🎧, with a focus on predicting the next track in a playlist 🔮. By leveraging machine learning models 🤖, we aim to enhance the user experience by providing personalized recommendations based on user behavior, track sequences, and genre preferences. The project uses **Spotify’s Million Playlist Dataset** 🎵, which includes track names, artist names, album names, and playlist metadata 📊, to train and evaluate multiple models including **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **BERT**, **XGBoost**, and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**.

## 🔄 Approach

The data preprocessing pipeline 🧹 involves cleaning text columns like track and artist names, followed by feature engineering 🛠️ to generate embeddings using **TF-IDF**, **BERT**, and **DistilBERT**. Sentiment analysis 💬 is applied to capture the emotional tone of the playlists 💖. Models are developed to predict the next track based on various features: **KNN** uses content-based filtering 🎶, **BERT** captures semantic context in track names 📝, and **XGBoost** handles numerical and categorical features 📊. The performance is evaluated through **AUC** and cosine similarity scores 📈.

## 🔍 Key Insights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊 reveals trends such as the average number of tracks in popular playlists and dominant genres like Hip-Hop 🎤. These insights help refine the models and their predictions. **KNN** was found to work well for smaller datasets, while **BERT** effectively captured the contextual meaning of playlist titles 🧠, and **XGBoost** excelled in handling high-dimensional data 🔢. The **RNN** model, particularly the **LSTM** variant, showed potential for improving sequence-based predictions 🔄, leveraging the dependencies between consecutive tracks in playlists.

## 🚀 Future Directions

The project demonstrates promising results 🌟, but further work can improve the system's accuracy 🎯. Incorporating user feedback loops 🔄, real-time predictions ⏱️, and audio features like tempo and rhythm 🎶 could enhance recommendations. Additionally, analyzing mood-based playlists 💭 will provide insights into the connection between music and emotional well-being 🧘. This work sets the foundation for more personalized and engaging music recommendation systems on platforms like Spotify 🎧.
